  // Clear any running timers
  if (this.state.autoProgressTimer) {

    this.state.autoProgressTimer = undefined;
  }

  // Reset state to initial values
  this.state = {
    mode: 'MODERATED_DEBATE',
    topic: '',
    debateHistory: [],
    isPaused: false,
    isRunning: false,
    currentPhase: 'setup',
